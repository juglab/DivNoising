    "# DivNoising - Training\n",
    "This notebook contains an example on how to train a DivNoising VAE.  This requires having a noise model (model of the imaging noise) which can be either measured from calibration data or estimated from raw noisy images themselves. If you haven't done so, please first run either ```0a-CreateNoiseModel.ipynb``` (if you have calibration data to create a noise model from) or the ntebook ```0b-CreateNoiseModel.ipynb``` if you do not have calibration data and you wish to use noisy images themselves to bootstrap a noise model. These notebooks will download the data and create a noise model. "
